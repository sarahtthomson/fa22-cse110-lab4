1. It will print out 3 because you are printing out the value of i. When the for loop is exited it will be 3 because length is 2 so when it gets to 3 it exits.
2. It prints out 150 which is the last value of discounted price when it exits the for loop. this is found from 300 * 1 - 0.5
3. It will print out 150 because that is the last value of final price when it exits the for loop. 150 * 100 / 100 = finalPrice.
4. It returns the array discounted which would be [50, 100, 150]. This is because .push adds a value onto the end of the array so each time the for loop runs it adds finalPrice to the end of the array discounted which is what gets returned.
5. i only exists in the for loop, so when you try to print out the value of i it errors.
6. discountedPrice only exists in the for loop because it is a let variable so therefor it will error because in line 13 discountedPrice can not be seen.
