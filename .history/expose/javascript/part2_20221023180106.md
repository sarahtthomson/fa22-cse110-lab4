1. It will print out 3 because you are printing out the value of i. When the for loop is exited it will be 3 because length is 2 so when it gets to 3 it exits.
2. It prints out 150 which is the last value of discounted price when it exits the for loop. this is found from 300 * 1 - 0.5
3. It will print out 150 because that is the last value of final price when it exits the for loop. 150 * 100 / 100 = finalPrice.
4. It returns the array discounted which would be [50, 100, 150]. This is because .push adds a value onto the end of the array so each time the for loop runs it adds finalPrice to the end of the array discounted which is what gets returned.
5. i only exists in the for loop, so when you try to print out the value of i it errors.
6. discountedPrice only exists in the for loop because it is a let variable so therefor it will error because in line 13 discountedPrice can not be seen.
7. It prints out 150 because it is still in the scope that finalPrice was defined in which is the function discountPrices.
8. it will return [50, 100, 150] it is still in the scope that discounted was defined in which is the function discountPrices.
9. At line 11 it errors because i is declared as let which means it only exists within that for loop, 11 is out of the for loop.
10. It prints out 3 because length is defined as a constant, is never changed, and is defined in the same scope as line 12.
11. It returns the array discounted, which is [50, 100, 150], you can push to a constant array which is why this does not error.
