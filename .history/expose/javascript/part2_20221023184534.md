1. It will print out 3 because you are printing out the value of i. When the for loop is exited it will be 3 because length is 2 so when it gets to 3 it exits.
2. It prints out 150 which is the last value of discounted price when it exits the for loop. this is found from 300 * 1 - 0.5
3. It will print out 150 because that is the last value of final price when it exits the for loop. 150 * 100 / 100 = finalPrice.
4. It returns the array discounted which would be [50, 100, 150]. This is because .push adds a value onto the end of the array so each time the for loop runs it adds finalPrice to the end of the array discounted which is what gets returned.
5. i only exists in the for loop, so when you try to print out the value of i it errors.
6. discountedPrice only exists in the for loop because it is a let variable so therefor it will error because in line 13 discountedPrice can not be seen.
7. It prints out 150 because it is still in the scope that finalPrice was defined in which is the function discountPrices.
8. it will return [50, 100, 150] it is still in the scope that discounted was defined in which is the function discountPrices.
9. At line 11 it errors because i is declared as let which means it only exists within that for loop, 11 is out of the for loop.
10. It prints out 3 because length is defined as a constant, is never changed, and is defined in the same scope as line 12.
11. It returns the array discounted, which is [50, 100, 150], you can push to a constant array which is why this does not error.
12A. student.name;
12B. student['Grad Year'];
12C. student.greeting();
12D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name;
12E. student.courseLoad[0];
13A. 32 because integers map to strings so it concatenated 3 and 2 to get 32
13B. 1 because you can't subtract strings so the 3 is converted into an integer
13C. null converts to 0 so it becomes 3 + 0 = 3
13D. Turns null into a string and concatenates it with 3 so it becomes 3null
13E. True converts to 1, so 1 + 3 = 4
13F. False converts to 0 and null converts to 0, so 0 + 0 = 0
13G.undefined is turned into a string so it becomes 3undefined
13H. undefined is not valued as a number so it is NaN because you can subtract undefined
14A. true because '2' becomes the number 2 and 2 is greater than 1
14B. compares the strings and 2 is greater than 1 which is the first character of each so it is False
14C. True because '2' becomes the number 2 so they are equal
14D. does not converts the types so they are not equal, false.
14E. False converts to 0 which is not equal to 2, so False.
14F. anything but 0 is a boolean of true so when you convert 2 to a boolean it is true.
15. == checks if they are equal after converting to the same type, === checks if they are equal without converting the types.
17. In this scenario array = [1, 2, 3] and callback = doSomething. When it first goes in to modify array it creates an empty newArr. Then it goes in the for loop and will go through this 3 times because the array length is 3. The first time it will go in and run doSomething(1) and doSomething will return 2, then it will return 4, and then it will return 6. After each return these numbers will be added to the end of newArr. After all 3 are done it will exit the for loop and return newARR which will look like [2, 4, 6]
